## Overview

AI Track is a powerful tool designed to analyze social media engagement and sentiment across various platforms. Currently, it supports Twitter, with plans to expand to Telegram, Discord, and Reddit. The application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide insights into community health, engagement metrics, and risk factors associated with social media accounts.

## Special Feature

AI Track currently supports extracting Twitter data from pump.fun by providing:
- **A Solana Token Address.**
- **A Twitter Profile URL directly.**

This allows seamless integration for analyzing social media activity linked to specific blockchain projects or individual Twitter accounts.

## Features

- **Engagement Metrics**: Calculate total engagement rates, activity growth, and platform breakdowns.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment scores and interpret them into human-readable formats.
- **Community Insights**: Gather insights on total followers, active members, and growth rates.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks based on community health and engagement metrics.
- **Trending Topics**: Extract trending topics from social media discussions.
